# Story Starter

A project for practicing a code gen workflow. Users can give character or story elements to an LLM and get story ideas they can use as a starting point and to help them think of ideas.

It will be hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://ljacobdev.github.io/story-starter)


Several 'prompt plan' files were generated because 4o was initially being too brief, and a few attempts were made at improving it until I had claude sonnet 4 make the prompt plan instead, since it might know how best to structure the prompts for itself to use as the implementing agent.

I thought I'd make some different git branches to see what happens if I use one or another prompt plan, and see if one method is faster and still succeeds, or whether the more thorough one turns out better even if it takes longer.


The purpose of doing this project is to get practice with agentic coding, and stress test what it's able to do.  The code and tests are not being deeply scrutinized in this project, and the main concern is with getting the high level functionality and appearance to work, while then iterating on this kind of project again additional times to start focusing on code organization and quality.
