# Story Starter

A project for practicing a code gen workflow. Users can give character or story elements to an LLM and get story ideas they can use as a starting point and to help them think of ideas.

It will be hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://ljacobdev.github.io/story-starter)


Several 'prompt plan' files were generated because 4o was initially being too brief, and a few attempts were made at improving it until I had claude sonnet 4 make the prompt plan instead, since it might know how best to structure the prompts for itself to use as the implementing agent.

I thought I'd make some different git branches to see what happens if I use one or another prompt plan, and see if one method is faster and still succeeds, or whether the more thorough one turns out better even if it takes longer.
