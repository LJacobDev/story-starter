# Copilot Working Memory Reference

## Current Project State
- **Last Known Good State**: Task 2.1.1 completion - Authentication forms rendering with 90/90 tests passing
- **Currently Working**: Investigating Task 2.1.2 authentication issues - forms marked complete but functionality broken
- **Last Test Results**: Unknown - need to verify current test status after authentication implementation attempts
- **Known Issues**: Authentication buttons non-functional (white screen, disabled buttons, validation blocking submission)

## Key File Relationships
- `useAuthForm.ts` depends on: validation utilities, auth types, Vue reactivity system
- `SignInForm.vue` uses: useAuthForm composable, useAuth composable, ShadCN UI components (Button, Input, Card)
- `SignUpForm.vue` uses: useAuthForm composable, useAuth composable, ShadCN UI components
- `useAuth.ts` depends on: Supabase client, auth types, Vue reactivity
- Authentication flow: Form submission → useAuthForm validation → useAuth Supabase calls → state updates → UI feedback

## Recent Changes Made
- September 16, 2025: Modified form button disabled logic to remove validation dependency
- September 16, 2025: Attempted to fix form validation blocking in useAuthForm.ts handleSubmit function
- September 16, 2025: Created comprehensive documentation for repomix usage and large file handling
- September 16, 2025: Updated authentication forms to bypass strict validation for basic functionality

## Next Steps Plan
1. **Roll back to Task 2.1.1 completion state** using git reset to stable working forms
2. **Verify application loads correctly** with npm run dev and test basic form rendering
3. **Restart Task 2.1.2 with simpler approach** - focus on basic authentication integration first
4. **Generate focused repomix files** for authentication system analysis before major changes

## Complexity Warning Signs
- [x] More than 5 files need changes (authentication touched many interconnected files)
- [x] Test failure cascade suspected (changes likely broke multiple test scenarios)
- [x] Can't predict impact of changes (validation changes had unexpected side effects)
- [x] Circular dependency patterns in form validation and authentication state

## Assumptions About the Project That Changed When New Things Were Learned
- **Initial assumption**: Complex form validation was necessary for authentication
- **New information learned**: Overly strict validation was preventing any form submission attempts
- **Initial assumption**: Authentication infrastructure was working despite UI issues
- **New information learned**: Form button disabled state was blocking all authentication attempts regardless of backend functionality

## Human Parseable Summary of State and Insights Derived From Recent Analysis
- **Authentication System Status**: Task 2.1.2 marked as complete in todo checklist but functionality is broken
- **Technical Debt**: Complex validation system (useAuthForm, validation utils) created interdependencies that block basic functionality
- **Architecture Issues**: Form validation, authentication logic, and UI state are tightly coupled, making debugging difficult
- **Immediate Priority**: Roll back to stable state and restart with simpler, more testable approach
- **Context Management**: Project reaching complexity where AI agent needs focused repomix files rather than comprehensive analysis
- **Documentation Added**: Created extensive repomix usage guides and architectural recommendations for AI-optimal development patterns

## Repomix File Size Management Strategy

### Current Approach
- **No current repomix files**: Project state needs baseline generation after rollback
- **Recommended focused approach**: Generate separate files for overview, auth logic, and auth components
- **Estimated safe sizes**: Each layer should be under 50KB for reliable AI processing

### When to Generate New Repomix
- **Immediately after rollback**: Generate baseline authentication system state
- **Before Task 2.1.2 restart**: Generate focused repomix for authentication components only
- **After each major milestone**: Document working state for future reference

### Context Refresh Indicators
- **Current status**: Context needs refresh after rollback to understand actual working state
- **Recent indicators**: AI agent made assumptions about authentication system that proved incorrect
- **Recommended action**: Generate focused repomix after rollback to establish accurate baseline understanding
