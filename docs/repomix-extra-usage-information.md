# Repomix Extra Usage Information: Advanced Strategies and Patterns

*Supplementary guide covering advanced repomix usage patterns, layered documentation approaches, and project-specific strategies discovered through practical application*

## Layered Documentation Approach: Deep Dive

### Why Layered Approach is Superior for AI Agents

Based on practical experience with complex Vue 3 + TypeScript projects, the layered documentation approach has proven to be **ideal for AI processing capabilities**. Here's the detailed analysis:

#### **AI Processing Benefits**

1. **Builds Understanding Incrementally**
   - **Overview first** - AI understands the big picture before diving into details
   - **Logic second** - AI grasps the data flow and business rules
   - **Components last** - AI sees how the UI implements the logic

2. **Each Layer is Self-Contained Enough**
   - **Overview layer** - Standalone understanding of project structure
   - **Core logic layer** - Can analyze business logic patterns independently
   - **Components layer** - Can evaluate UI patterns with context from previous layers

3. **Reduces Cognitive Load**
   - AI can focus on one architectural concern at a time
   - Less context switching between different types of code
   - Cleaner mental model of each layer's responsibilities

### Practical Layer Definitions

#### **Layer 1: High-Level Overview**
```bash
# Project structure, main entry points, configuration
repomix --include "src/main.ts,src/App.vue,package.json,vite.config.ts,README.md" --output overview.txt
```

**What this gives AI agents:**
- Application architecture and entry points
- Technology stack and dependencies
- Overall project structure and organization
- Key configuration decisions

**Typical size:** 5-10KB (always safe)

#### **Layer 2: Core Logic**
```bash
# Business logic, composables, utilities, types
repomix --include "src/composables/**/*,src/types/**/*,src/lib/**/*,src/utils/**/*" --output core-logic.txt
```

**What this gives AI agents:**
- Data flow and state management patterns
- Business logic implementation
- Type definitions and interfaces
- Utility functions and helpers

**Typical size:** 15-25KB (safe for most projects)

#### **Layer 3: Components**
```bash
# UI components and views
repomix --include "src/components/**/*,src/views/**/*" --output components.txt
```

**What this gives AI agents:**
- Component hierarchy and relationships
- UI patterns and conventions
- Template structures and styling approaches
- Component communication patterns

**Typical size:** 20-30KB (manageable for focused work)

### Advanced Layering Strategies

#### **Phase-Based Layered Approach**

For projects with multiple development phases (like Story Starter with 6 phases):

```bash
# Phase 2: Authentication System
repomix --include "src/main.ts,src/App.vue,src/router/**/*" --output auth-overview.txt
repomix --include "src/composables/useAuth*,src/types/auth.ts,src/lib/supabase.ts" --output auth-logic.txt  
repomix --include "src/components/auth/**/*,src/views/auth/**/*" --output auth-components.txt
```

**Benefits:**
- Focuses AI attention on current working phase
- Reduces irrelevant context from other features
- Maintains manageable file sizes throughout development

#### **Feature-Based Layered Approach**

For complex features that span multiple architectural layers:

```bash
# Story Generation Feature (Future Phase 4)
repomix --include "src/types/story.ts,src/lib/gemini.ts" --output story-overview.txt
repomix --include "src/composables/useStory*,src/utils/prompt*" --output story-logic.txt
repomix --include "src/components/story/**/*" --output story-components.txt
```

**Use cases:**
- Before implementing complex features like Task 4.1.1
- When debugging issues that span multiple architectural concerns
- For architectural review and refactoring planning

### Limitations and Mitigation Strategies

#### **Minor Limitations Identified**

1. **Cross-Layer References**
   - AI might miss some import/dependency relationships between layers
   - Need to reference multiple files to trace complete data flow
   - Some architectural decisions span multiple layers

2. **Context Switching Cost**
   - AI needs to remember insights from previous layers
   - Cannot see all relationships in a single view
   - May need to refer back to earlier layers

#### **Proven Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Sequential Processing Workflow**
   ```
   1. Share overview.txt → AI understands project structure
   2. Share core-logic.txt → AI understands business logic
   3. Share components.txt → AI understands UI implementation
   4. Ask specific questions about cross-layer relationships
   ```

2. **Summary Updates in Copilot-Context.md**
   - After each layer, AI updates `.github/copilot-context.md` with key insights
   - This preserves understanding across layers
   - Creates searchable record of architectural insights

3. **Cross-Reference Documentation**
   ```markdown
   ## Layered Understanding Status
   
   ### Overview Layer (Processed)

   ```

## Project-Specific Repomix Strategies

### For Vue 3 + Composition API + TypeScript Projects

#### **Optimal Include Patterns**
```bash
# Safe comprehensive approach (usually under 50KB)
repomix --include "src/**/*.{ts,vue}" --exclude "**/*.test.ts,**/*.spec.ts" --output vue-project.txt

# Focus on composition API patterns
repomix --include "src/composables/**/*,src/types/**/*" --output composables-analysis.txt

# UI component analysis
repomix --include "src/components/**/*.vue" --output components-analysis.txt
```

#### **Authentication System Specific**
```bash
# Current working example for Story Starter
repomix --include "src/components/auth/**/*,src/composables/useAuth*,src/types/auth.ts,src/lib/supabase.ts" --output auth-system.txt

# Form validation focus
repomix --include "src/composables/useAuthForm*,src/utils/validation.ts,src/components/*Form.vue" --output form-system.txt
```

### For Supabase Integration Projects

#### **Backend Integration Analysis**
```bash
# Supabase client and types
repomix --include "src/lib/supabase.ts,src/types/database.ts,src/types/auth.ts" --output supabase-integration.txt

# Database operations and composables
repomix --include "src/composables/use*,src/lib/**/*" --exclude "**/*.test.ts" --output database-operations.txt
```

## Workflow Integration Patterns

### Package.json Script Integration

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "repomix:auth": "repomix --include 'src/components/auth/**/*,src/composables/useAuth*,src/types/auth.ts' --output auth-context.txt && echo 'Auth context generated'",
    "repomix:overview": "repomix --include 'src/main.ts,src/App.vue,package.json,vite.config.ts' --output overview.txt && echo 'Overview generated'",
    "repomix:logic": "repomix --include 'src/composables/**/*,src/types/**/*,src/lib/**/*' --output core-logic.txt && echo 'Core logic generated'",
    "repomix:components": "repomix --include 'src/components/**/*,src/views/**/*' --output components.txt && echo 'Components generated'",
    "repomix:check-sizes": "ls -lh *.txt | grep repomix || echo 'No repomix files found'"
  }
}
```

### Development Workflow Integration

#### **Before Major Tasks**
1. **Generate baseline** understanding with layered approach
2. **Update copilot-context.md** with current state
3. **Check file sizes** to ensure they're under 50KB
4. **Process layers sequentially** with AI agent

#### **During Development**
1. **Update focused repomix** for areas being modified
2. **Regenerate after significant changes** to maintain accuracy
3. **Use task-specific repomix** for complex features

#### **After Task Completion**
1. **Generate milestone repomix** to document completed state
2. **Archive previous versions** for rollback reference
3. **Update copilot-context.md** with lessons learned

## Advanced Size Management Techniques

### Dynamic Size Checking

```bash
# Create function to check size before sharing with AI
check_repomix_size() {
    local file=$1
    local size=$(stat -c%s "$file" 2>/dev/null || stat -f%z "$file" 2>/dev/null)
    local kb=$((size / 1024))
    
    if [ $kb -gt 80 ]; then
        echo "⚠️  File too large: ${kb}KB (limit: 80KB)"
        return 1
    elif [ $kb -gt 50 ]; then
        echo "⚠️  File approaching limit: ${kb}KB (recommended: <50KB)"
        return 2
    else
        echo "✅ File size OK: ${kb}KB"
        return 0
    fi
}

# Usage
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts" --output test.txt
check_repomix_size test.txt
```

### Selective Exclusion Strategies

```bash
# Exclude by file type
repomix --exclude "**/*.{jpg,png,gif,pdf,zip,test.ts,spec.ts}" --output focused.txt

# Exclude by directory
repomix --exclude "node_modules,dist,.git,coverage,docs/repomix-outputs" --output clean.txt

# Include only essential files
repomix --include "src/**/*.{ts,vue}" --exclude "**/test/**,**/*.test.*" --output essential.txt
```

## Context Management Best Practices

### AI Agent Context Refresh Indicators

Watch for these signs that context needs refreshing:

1. **AI references files that don't exist** in current repomix
2. **AI misses obvious dependencies** shown in the files
3. **AI suggests changes that conflict** with existing patterns
4. **AI appears confident but provides incomplete analysis**

### Response Protocols

When AI agent encounters these issues:

```markdown
**AI Agent Response Template:**
"I notice [specific issue indicating context problems]. This suggests my context needs refreshing.

Recommended action:
1. Generate fresh repomix: `npm run repomix:auth`
2. Check file size: `check_repomix_size auth-context.txt`
3. If size OK, share the updated file
4. If too large, use more focused includes

This will ensure I have accurate, complete context for the current project state."
```

### Human Developer Response Protocols

When context refresh is needed:

1. **Generate appropriate repomix** based on current working area
2. **Check file size** before sharing
3. **Update copilot-context.md** with any state changes
4. **Verify AI understanding** with a simple question about the codebase

## Measuring Repomix Effectiveness

### Success Indicators

**Positive signs that repomix is working well:**
- AI demonstrates complete understanding of feature relationships
- AI can predict side effects of changes accurately

## Summary and Recommendations

### Key Takeaways

1. **Layered approach is superior** for AI understanding compared to monolithic repomix files
2. **Each layer should be under 50KB** for reliable AI processing
3. **Sequential processing** builds better understanding than trying to process everything at once
4. **Project-specific strategies** are more effective than generic approaches
5. **Regular context refresh** is essential for maintaining accuracy

### Recommended Implementation for Story Starter

Given the project structure (6 phases, complex authentication, story generation features):

```bash
# Immediate next steps
npm run repomix:overview   # Establish baseline understanding
npm run repomix:auth      # Focus on current authentication issues
npm run repomix:check-sizes  # Verify files are appropriately sized

# Future phases
npm run repomix:story-generation  # Before Phase 4 implementation
npm run repomix:ui-polish        # Before Phase 6 polish work
```

### Integration with Development Workflow

- **Use layered repomix** before each major task
- **Update copilot-context.md** after each layer is processed
- **Generate milestone repomix** after task completion
- **Archive and version** repomix files for rollback reference

This approach transforms repomix from a simple code dumping tool into a sophisticated context management system that enables more effective AI-assisted development.
